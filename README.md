# Appendix (D): Python files

This repository contains Python files used for Aryan Yekrangi's MA thesis with the topic: 
The sub-folder Experiment 1 contains the Python files written for Section 4.1 of the MA thesis. It consists of five Python files, each corresponding to one classification approach. The feature set used to train and test each classifier has been defined on line [x] of each Python file.

The sub-folder Experiment 2 contains the Python files written for Section 4.2 of the MA thesis. It consists of three Python files, each corresponding to onne classification approach. The feature set used to train and test each classifier has again been defined on line [x] of each Python file.

The sub-folder Feature Extractor contains one Python program which was used to convert .txt files into .csv data frame. This sub-folder also contains a few additional data fiels, mostly in the form of word lists, which were used to calculate some of the features or preprocess the data.
