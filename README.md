# Appendix (D): Python files

This repository contains Python files used for Aryan Yekrangi's MA thesis
The sub-folder Experiment contains the Python files written for section 4.1 of the MA thesis. It consists of five python files, each corresponding to one classification approach. The feature set used to train and test each classifier has to bee defined in the Python file seperately (one line x for all classifiers).
